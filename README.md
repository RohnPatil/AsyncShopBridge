ThinkBridge Async ShopBridge Assignment

This is A backend solution for Product functionality to be used by Product
Admin, and perform below actions:
1. Add a new item to the inventory (The item should require a name, description, and price
as basic fileds, think of additional information that would be useful)
2. Modify an item in the inventory.
3. Delete an item from the inventory.
4. Lists the items in the inventory.

-> Use a relational (SQL Server / MSSQL / Postgres) database and any ORM you feel
comfortable with for any persistent data storage needs. All of the functions of
the backend need to be served by an API call and the storeâ€™s inventory should be persisted
across restarts of the backend process.
-> All API calls should be asynchronous.
-> Include data validations as and when needed.
